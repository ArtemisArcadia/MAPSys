# MAPSys

If you download the folder and run the files inside (provided you have java installed) it should run a small simulation of a "murderer" in a house with several people. Depending on how many people are in the house with the murderer and how many are "watching" the "murderer", as each interaction takes place the propensity that someone will take a "killing action" on someone else will change. The simulation ends with one "person" left in the house.
